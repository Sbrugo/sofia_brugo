# 👩‍💻 Sofia Brugo — Backend Developer (Node.js / NestJS)

Backend Developer with a strong focus on REST APIs, Node.js/NestJS, and TypeScript.  
Experience building structured, modular backends with attention to clean architecture, validation, and business logic.

I have a solid foundation in Java and object-oriented design, including SOLID principles and classic design patterns. My main interest is developing clear, maintainable, and testable backend systems rather than adding unnecessary complexity.

This profile contains learning and practice projects oriented toward real backend use cases, including API development, data validation, and frontend–backend integration.
